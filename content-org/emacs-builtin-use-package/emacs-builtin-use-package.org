* What is use-package anyway?
[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][Simply put, it's a macro for easier package management within /Emacs/]]. I've used this for a while, and for me this is much more manageable than the default package declaration.
* How to use it?
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
First we'll need to activate it, from your /Emacs/ ~init.el~ file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'use-package)
#+end_src
And since we'll mostly use this for external package, also add:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+end_src
After that, =use-package= is ready to use. For example, installing [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] is simply by:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package which-key)
#+end_src
If you don't enable the variable =use-package-always-ensure=, then we'll need to also use the keyword =:ensure=, to make sure the package is downloaded.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package which-key
    :ensure)
#+end_src
* Useful external packages
** Which-key
Just like our example [[id:dbba8c9f-3de4-4eab-a28c-1734dc17588a][earlier]], =which-key= is my most needed external packages. It display the keybinding following our incomplete command (or in /Emacs/ term: a prefix). For example, in default /Emacs/ when we want to open file we use the ~C-x C-f~ chord. When we input ~C-x~ and pause, nothing really shown.

[[./prefix-key.png][file:prefix-key.png]]

There's only =C-x= displayed in the echo area (in the bottom), but with =which-key-mode= activated:

[[./which-key-mode.png][file:which-key-mode.png]]
** Further which-key customization
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package which-key
  :ensure
  :custom
  (which-key-lighter "")
  (which-key-sort-order #'which-key-key-order-alpha)
  (which-key-sort-uppercase-first nil)
  (which-key-add-column-padding 1)
  (which-key-max-display-columns nil)
  (which-key-min-display-lines 6)
  (which-key-compute-remaps t)
  (which-key-side-window-slot -10)
  (which-key-separator " → ")
  (which-key-allow-evil-operators t)
  (which-key-use-C-h-commands t)
  (which-key-show-remaining-keys t)
  (which-key-show-prefix 'bottom)
  :config
  (which-key-mode)
  (which-key-setup-side-window-bottom)
  (which-key-setup-minibuffer)
  (define-key which-key-mode-map (kbd "C-x <f5>") 'which-key-C-h-dispatch))
#+end_src
This is the setup I used for =which-key=.
