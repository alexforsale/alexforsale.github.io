Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a flexible, powerful, server-side application for playing music. Through plugins and libraries it can play a variety of sound files while being controlled by its network protocol[fn:1].

It plays audio files, organizes playlists and maintains a music database, all while using very few resources. In order to interface with it, a separate client is needed. [fn:2]

So why using a server - client model for playing music?

* Simplicity
For me, I just want to listen to music. I don't have a preferred application for listening music, though I really don't enjoy all the streaming services. Mostly because the songs I liked now is still the same music I liked 10 years ago. I rarely listen to new music (most bands that I liked don't release new record anymore). Which brings us the next reason.

* I only want to listen to music
I don't want to depend on internet just to fill my ear with music. Even when internet connection is /kinda/ mandatory nowadays, I can proudly (or humbly?) say: "I want some time for myself, and it does not require internet connection". This is why I store my music locally, just like the old days. I even store my music locally in my phone. Would it be a hassle to synchronize? No, actually, If you use a GUI client for /MPD/, such as /cantata/, it has a feature for synch between devices (most player have this functionality). I used [[https://syncthing.net/][syncthing]] for file synchronization and it works as expected.


* It's about the music, not the music player
Back when I don't know about MPD, I have to choose various options for music player (which sometimes limited by the desktop environment I'm using at the time, /Rhythmbox/ does not look good on /KDE/). And when I'm started using /window manager/ instead of a full desktop environment, most of the music player I've tried ended up wasting 1 workspace just for listening music.

And /MPD/ does not need a dedicated client to run, by default, it has /mpc/, which is the commmand line interface for mpd (usually packaged as =mpc=, but sometimes differently depending on your distribution since there's already a package named =libmpc= for arithmetic library).
