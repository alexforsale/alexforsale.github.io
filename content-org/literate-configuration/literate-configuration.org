* Background

I'm spending most of my long vacation reorganizing my /github/ repositories, archiving some old repos (mostly /android/ stuffs that I don't use anymore). And when I'm looking into my /dotfiles/ repos I remember once I've tried to use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming/][literate programming]] to manage them. I think one of the difficulties I had was editing the source code block inline.

#+begin_src org
  This is how code block looks like in /Emacs/
  ,#+begin_src sh
    echo true
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

Editing code blocks inline has many disadvantages, for one, indentation is quite tricky. You'll never know the whitespaces until you tangled them. I'm sure there are solutions for this problems, but for now I just =org-edit-special= (bound to ~C-c '~).

* Reorganizing my repositories
Right now, I'm doing my dotfiles[fn:1] one by one, and I've come to realize how unmaintainable they are now. Basically, /[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles/][dotfiles]]/ are user-specific configuration files. While reorganizing them I saw configuration that are outdated, unneeded, or just plain wrong. I keep small configuration together in one repository (e.g. if it's X11-related, or wayland-specific, or just shell init files). Some of them have grown big enough to have their own separate repository.

* Using =github-action= to create each page on /github/
My goal is to have a /self-documenting/ page for each repositories. Not too detailed to be a /wiki/, just a reminder for me, or anyone who happens to see it. Another nice thing is that the /about/ section in the github repository page can automatically link the page.
* What I've done

** /Emacs/
The first thing I did. It give me the opportunity to rework my configuration, and the /github workflows/ I use in this repository is going to be my /worfklow/ template for other repository[fn:2].

* My Todo List

** TODO My /GNU Guix/ configuration
:LOGBOOK:
- State "TODO"       from              [2024-03-12 Tue 18:35]
:END:
This /[[https://guix.gnu.org/][distribution]]/ always have a special place in my mind. And /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Guile/][Guile]] scheme/ is such an elegant language. I'd like to use it someday if I got the time.

** DONE Shell initialization files

:LOGBOOK:
- State "PROG"       from              [2024-03-12 Tue 18:39]

Still migrating, some application(s) may need its own separate repository[fn:4].

Still in progress, took some time because at the moment I'm using /Hyprland/ in /wayland/. But the repository is already migrated[fn:6].
