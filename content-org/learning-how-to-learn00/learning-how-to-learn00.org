I accidentally stumbled upon an interesting blog post on [[https://aliabdaal.com/studying/how-to-learn-anything-faster/][how to learn anything faster]]. This is a good excuse to document my learning process.

In short, it advised us to use these 9 this for learning:
* Sharpen The Axe
** It's About the Meta Learning
Do some research on the topic you want to learn, usually other people has done it before.
* Use Crutches to Optimise Focus
** Do It Actively
** 5-minutes Rule
- work it for 5 minutes.
- stop it if you don't want to do it anymore. Perhaps re-evaluate the first tips?
** Remove distraction
* Find Opportunities for Immersion
** We learn best when we’re in the environment where we’re actually going to be using the skill.
* Figure Out Your Weak Links
** Focus on drills to improve them.
* Test Yourself
** Active Recall
We actually learn, counterintuitively, by trying to take stuff out of our brains.
** Set a desirable difficulty
* Get Regular intense feedback
** Getting a coach?
* Overlearn
** Continuously asking why a thing works the way that it does.
** Tweak stuffs.
* Use Spacing
** Spaced repetition.
*** NEXT How much space though?
