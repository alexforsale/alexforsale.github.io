The default /Emacs/ is kinda boring and unintuitive, if you're looking for a simple text editor, I really suggest other editors like /nano/, /vim/, or other graphical editors like /gedit/. The main advantage of using /Emacs/ is that in can be more than just a text editor.

I don't think anybody ever want to play tetris inside /Emacs/, but it's there!

The /dired-mode/ enable us to "edit directory" (DIRectory EDitor), delete, rename, print etc.

/Eshell/ is a shell-like interpreter implemented in /Emacs Lisp/.

So, without any configuration, /Emacs/ is very usable. But first we need to know the basic.
* The Basic
** terminology
| emacs  | rest of the world |
| frame  | program window    |
| window | pane              |
| buffer | file              |
| kill   | cut               |
| yank   | paste             |
| region | selection         |
** Screen organization
*** Point
Basically, the cursor. By default, it is a solid block, the point appear /on/ a character, but actually situated /before/ the character under the cursor.
*** The echo area
The line at the very bottom of the frame, useful for displaying /error messages/ or other informative messages.
*** The modeline
Located at the bottom of each window describing what's going on in the current buffer. If there's only one window, the mode line appears above the echo area; it is next-to-last in the frame.
*** Menu bar
Located at the top of each frame.
** Keys
Keyboard shortcuts, for examples:
#+begin_example
M-x tetris
#+end_example
=M= stands for ~Alt~, so press and hold =Alt=, press =x=, release and type =tetris= and press ~Enter~.
#+begin_example
C-x C-f /path/to/some/file
#+end_example
=C= stands for ~Control~, so press and hold ~CTRL~, release, and press and hold ~CTRL~, press =f=, release, and type some path to a file.
** Modes
Each buffer is associated with something called =major mode=, and may have one or more active =minor modes=. Modes are sets of specific rules and/or keybindings for some buffers. There are read-only mode that forbid you from editing a buffer, there's also language-specific modes for programming languages.
To get a detailed description for the current buffer:
#+begin_example
C-h m
#+end_example

To get all the available keybindings in the current buffer/mode:
#+begin_example
C-h b
#+end_example
** Tutorial
This will get you started with /Emacs/, open the tutorial buffer with:
#+begin_example
C-h t
#+end_example
* Configuration file
The configuration file itself is written in /Emacs Lisp/. The default location is traditionally in ~~/.emacs~, although /Emacs/ will also look at ~~/.emacs.el~, ~/.emacs.d/init.el~, and ~~/.config/emacs/init.el~. Though if you put your configuration files in ~~/.config/emacs~ directory, be aware that it will not used if ~~/.emacs~ file or ~~/.emacs.d/~ directory already exists,
* Some useful sane defaults
** =use-short-answer=
Use short answer for each confirmation ("y" or "n", instead of "yes" or "no").
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default use-short-answers t)
#+end_src
** disable menu / tool / scroll bar
Useful if you're already comfortable with the keyboard-centric workflow, and you want to expand the buffer as much as possible.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src
** disable splash-screen
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-startup-screen t)
#+end_src
** resize windows pixelwise
This affect /split-window/, /maximize-window/, /minimize-window/, /fit-window-to-buffer/, and /fit-frame-to-buffer/.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq window-resize-pixelwise t)
#+end_src
** resize frame pixelwise
Neccessary if you're using window-managers.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq frame-resize-pixelwise t)
#+end_src
** Ask for confirmatino when exiting /Emacs/
The default is don't ask for confirmation (nil)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq confirm-kill-emacs #'yes-or-no-p)
#+end_src
** enable save-place-mode
Save the point to the last place when the buffer is previously visited.
#+begin_example
(setq save-place-mode t)
#+end_example
** enable savehist-mode
Save the minibuffer history.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(savehist-mode t)
#+end_src
** separate Customization file elsewhere
By default this file is appended to the init file, which usually not desired.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file (locate-user-emacs-file "custom.el")
        (when (file-exists-p custom-file)
          (load custom-file)))
#+end_src
this snippet will ensure the file is separated and loaded when starting /Emacs/.
** Ignore case in completion
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq read-buffer-completion-ignore-case t
        read-file-name-completion-ignore-case t
        completion-ignore-case t)
#+end_src
