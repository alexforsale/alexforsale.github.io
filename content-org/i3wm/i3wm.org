I3wm is my first venture into the world of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager][tiling window manager]]. After several months getting familiar to /gnome/ desktop environment (in /fedora/, /debian/, and /ubuntu/ of course), I got to know /archlinux/. I got to know how a /linux/ desktop is basically a collection of packages (just like the operating system itself). And with /archlinux/, I have this freedom (for better or worse), to choose what packages I want to install into my system.

So why I3wm? I tried many other window managers, both tiling and dynamic, and maybe just like many others, I3wm was the first I tried. And it just happens that the default configuration is usable (for me at least, aside from the weird ~j~, ~k~, ~l~, ~;~ keys).

For me, i3wm is a good starting point for delving into window managers. You can start using it with minimal dependencies (=dmenu= and =i3status=). And the [[https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html][documentation on their website]] is very detailed.

And though it is still currently maintained, it rarely breaks when updated. I pretty much use I3wm even for my work environment (which mostly doing remote connection to other machines). I do like /wayland/, but I really don't see the benefit of moving to it when /Xorg/ is doing just fine.

I have a separate [[https://alexforsale.github.io/dotfiles-i3/][configuration]], and it's stored at my [[https://github.com/alexforsale/dotfiles-i3][github repository]]. At first, I thought configuring I3 is just tinkering inside the config file (=~/.config/i3/config=). As I started using I3 also learn how to configure my i3status, replace /dmenu/ with /rofi/, using dunst for notification, and also configuring /picom/.
