For some reason, I needed to work on /Windows/, and considering my shift is a 12 hours work, I needed something to tinker when I get some quiet time. I just realised it's been years since I've use /Windows/ for something other than web browsing.

So this post is an experience on installing /Emacs/ on /Debian/.
* WSL
You should follow the official documentation on how to install /WSL/, so I won't be writing about it here.

As for the reasoning for choosing /Debian/? Because it's not /Ubuntu/, nothing against it, I just wan't a simpler /distro/, and I use /archlinux/, this is /WSL/, it's doesn't make any sense trying to have /archlinux/ inside it.
** Updating APT sources
Out of the box, the sources list doesn't have any of the /deb-src/ and /non-free-firmware/ stuffs.
#+name: /etc/apt/sources.list
#+caption: Always check the Debian wiki!
#+begin_src conf
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main non-free-firmware
deb-src https://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm main non-free-firmware

deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main non-free-firmware
deb-src https://security.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security main non-free-firmware

deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bookworm-security main non-free-firmware
deb-src https://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-updates main non-free-firmware

deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main non-free-firmware
#+end_src

* Emacs
After updating /apt/, run this:
#+name: apt build-dep
#+begin_src sh :tangle no
  sudo apt build-dep emacs
#+end_src

I'm guessing this is for /Emacs/ dependencies. But I still need install other packages via /apt/:

#+name: other dependencies
#+begin_src sh :tangle no
  sudo apt install libmagickwand-dev libmagickcore-dev wget curl git
#+end_src
/wget/ and /git/ are for getting the sources.

I also build /tree-sitter/ from source.

#+name: tree-sitter
#+begin_src sh :tangle no
  mkdir -pv sources
  cd ~/source/
  git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter.git
  cd tree-sitter
  make
  sudo make install
#+end_src

or you could also use /apt/ to install it. This is not a hard dependency, so it can be skipped if not used.

As for the /Emacs/ source, I use the tarball, their git repo is just too large. If you want to use their git repo I recommend using the --depth=1 option.

#+name: when using tarball
#+begin_src sh
  cd ~/sources
  wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/emacs-29.4.tar.xz
  tar xf emacs-29.4.tar.xz
  cd emacs-29.4
#+end_src

So this is my configure options:
#+name: compile Emacs
#+begin_src sh
  ./configure --with-native-compilation --with-pgtk --with-tree-sitter --with-modules --with-threads --with-mailutils --with-imagemagick --with-json
  make
  sudo make install
#+end_src
I suppose you can use other flags, but for now this is more than enough for me.

This will install Emacs using the default prefix (=/usr/local=), meaning the binary will be placed at =/usr/local/bin/=. Debian already include them to the shell path.
* Others
** Running Emacs
I usually just type this in the terminal:
#+name: running Emacs
#+begin_src sh
  setsid emacs
#+end_src
** My Emacs packages dependencies
*** fd-find and ripgrep
#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt install fd-find ripgrep
#+end_src
*** cmake
This is for compiling /vterm/.
#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt install cmake
#+end_src
*** all-the-icons
This package have it's own command for installing icons: ~all-the-icons-install-fonts~, run in inside Emacs using ~M-x~.
*** nerd-icons
This font collection is not on /Debian/ repository. I just pick some script I got from github, and modified it to store the fonts to ~~/.local/share/fonts~.
#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt install unzip
#+end_src

#+name: nerd-fonts installer script
#+begin_src sh :shebang /usr/bin/env bash :tangle no
